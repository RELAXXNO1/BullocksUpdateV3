## StoreHeader.tsx Outline

**Aesthetic:**

*   Relatively short height (80px).
*   Background with a subtle radial gradient and blurred backdrop.
*   Border at the bottom.
*   Overall "clean" and modern look.
*   Uses teal as a primary accent color.
*   **Animated Words:** Includes animated words "Wellness", "Mentality", "Mood", "Self", "Everything" that cycle through.

**Layout/Design:**

*   `header` element containing everything.
*   Absolute positioned radial gradient for background effect.
*   `container` div to center content horizontally.
*   `Link` to the homepage with the logo and brand name.
    *   Logo is on the left (hidden on small screens).
    *   Brand name "High10" with "High" in black and "10" in teal, followed by the animated word.
*   `nav` for navigation links and user menu.
*   Cart icon on the right.
*   NewUserMenu (the component we're working on) on the right, conditionally rendered based on user login status.

## UserMenu.tsx (and NewUserMenu.tsx) Outline

**Aesthetic:**

*   Menu appears as a modal/popup.
*   Uses a dark background with blurred backdrop.
*   Rounded corners and subtle shadows.
*   Teal accents (shadows, gradients).
*   Clean typography.

**Layout/Design:**

*   Conditionally rendered modal using `createPortal`.
*   Fixed positioning to overlay the rest of the page.
*   Contains links to:
    *   Account Details
    *   View Past Orders
    *   Admin Dashboard (conditionally rendered based on admin status)
    *   Log Out
    *   (Potentially other links)
*   PointsForJoints button
*   Uses `lucide-react` for the menu icon.
*   Uses `Badge` component for displaying points.

**Key Differences between UserMenu and NewUserMenu:**

*   Both seem to serve the same purpose.
*   NewUserMenu is currently being used in StoreHeader.
*   UserMenu is not currently used.
*   Both use createPortal.
